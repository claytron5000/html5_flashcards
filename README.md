# html5_flashcards

The HTML5 element set includes 113 elements, 105 if you exclude experiemental ones. There are some pretty cool tools that are will soon be available across browsers, I'm looking at you `<meter>`. Why not build a digital flashcard set to help us learn the elements?

If built well this tool could also be expanded to include CSS3, French, the Periodic table of elements, or whatever you'd like to learn!

Data is scrapped from `http://htmlreference.io/`, so thanks to them for that awesome resource.
